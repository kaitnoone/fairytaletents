  <p><span style="color:#0a7965; font-weight:bold;">We recently celebrated our ceremony and reception at my family home in New Lenox, and had the pleasure of working with Stephanie. </span> <br />She took care of every detail I needed and made sure everything was perfect! We had a major storm the night before and her feet were covered in mud but she never complained, she even brought my husband and I a plate of appetizers while we were shooting our photos, so that we could have something to eat. The tent, linens and lighting was breathtaking, and we're still so thankful for everything this company helped us with!</p>

  <p><span style="color:#0a7965; font-weight:bold;">You guys did a great job for my wedding!</span> <br />I loved the tent..everything came together very beautifully :) I appreciate everything you guys did to make my day special... I did not have to worry at all about anything.</p>
  <h3> – Tara Dooley, October 2014 Wedding</h3><br />
  <hr /><br />
  <p><span style="color:#0a7965"><strong>I had the pleasure of planning an event for a client. My name is Terry Knorr, a Wedding Planner. </strong></span></p>
  <p><br />
    My clients had chosen a tent  from a different company at first, the same day I found Fairy Tale Tents and  Events. </p>
  <p><br />
    After looking at their  website, they fell in love with Fairy Tale's tents. We started working with the  staff &amp; I cannot tell you how pleased the client was! Julie, Donna &amp;  Heather are fabulous! </p>
  <p><br />
    You have to understand, this  wedding was on the clients property in the middle of nowhere! With very little  power supply available, the staff guided us to generator suppliers that were  great.</p>
  <p><br />
    I was on site when  Dan(owner)and Tony (Crew Foreman)began the construction of the tent &amp;  laminate flooring they said the tent would withstand Gail force winds, it did!! </p>
  <p><br />
    The night before the wedding,  there were severe storms &amp; 3 inches of rain. The next morning I arrived at  the tent, under 2 inches of rain. <br />
    Dan knew about the rain and  called to see if they can come out to help! <br />
    I had already arranged help,  but I was very impressed that he would go out of his way to help us! That is  how the whole experience with Fairy Tale Tents was. </p>
  <p><br />
    The only glitch was 5 table  linens were soiled, not to the fault of Fairy Tale, but their vendor. When we  contacted Donna the morning of the event, she &amp; Heather were angels! </p>
  <p><br />
    They handled it and drove us  new linens, over 50 miles!! I would rate Fairy tale Tents 10.5 on a scale from  1-10. If you are looking for a beautiful Tent, linens, glassware and Excellent  Customer Service, Fairy Tale Tents and Events, is the place to call!</p>

  <p><em>I cannot thank you enough for helping with our wedding. You saved my life! You did an incredible job and I was never stressed during the entire process. You were patient, professional, and comforting. I know it is not your job to answer emails evenings and weekends and yet you did. That was so nice of you. The tent was fabulous and it was our dream wedding. The workers who set up the tent did a great job also. They were fun, pleasant, and so kind. I will be forever grateful that you dropped off the last tent wall and made an extra trip. I am SO glad we went with your company. It was a great experience, on that day, and all the days leading up to it. Thank you, thank you, thank you! </span></em></p>

<p><span style="color:#0a7965"><em><strong>Fairy Tale Tents,</strong></em></span></p>
<p><em>I must begin by saying Thank You for all your help in making our wedding the most spectacular experience! It always seems overwhelming when preparing to plan for an event of this magnitude, but your company made the entire process smooth and easy. The staff members; Tony, Dan, the boys, and the wait staff were all extremely professional, courteous, and of the highest quality. The explanation of the design and tent selection was clear and precise, and the final product did not disappoint in any way.</em><br />
  <br />
</p>
  <p><em>On the Thursday be
    fore the Saturday wedding, the men arrive early and worked tirelessly to install the tents, tables, chairs, linens, and any other equipment necessary for total success. They then returned on Friday to finish up any modifications and install the high quality bathroom facilities and sinks. It truly was a fairy tale on the lawn. On the day of the wedding, the bartenders and servers professionalism was impeccable. They never quit, assisted in every way, and might have event enjoyed themselves.</em><br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p><em>Whenever you embark on an adventure this big, it is necessary to have a company like Fairy Tale tents to assist you along the way. Not only do they provide the external structures, but they go above and beyond to ensure excellence of product and dynamics throughout the weekend. </em><br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p><em>Thank you for making our special day the greatest it could possibly be!</em></p>
